## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Initially this is a live testing ground. This may continue for an undefined length of time, for this particular project live testing is necessary.

The test is the thing you are looking at. I'm teaching myself the process in an unusual fashion.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/free-tron/free-tron.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
