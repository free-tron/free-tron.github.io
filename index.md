## Free-TRON

Initially this is a live testing ground. This may continue for an undefined length of time, for this particular project live testing is necessary.

The test is the thing you are looking at. I'm teaching myself the process in an unusual fashion.

You are welcome to pilfer any knowledge or code you might find interesting from this project.

### Goal

Complete my own brief education in using github pages. Hence the use of a blog-style template. This isn't going to BE a blog per se. Just a collection of files currently under test for various purposes and to get a handle of things from a flexibility perspective.

### Ultimate goal

Use github pages for a bigger probably closed-source web project. I'll make it open source if I can, but it will be for somebody else and so an agreement to the open-naturedness {sic} is in order before any release and further licensing.
